# These are my personal notes on Perl 

You are more than welcome to check & read this repo, tbh it's more of a personal thing and for me to be able to showcase what I have learned and to remember my notes. I am not responsible for any prod impact you may have and you definitely should not use these as a reference of anything. 

I will point you out to some cool Perl resources though:

1. My instructors [Git Hub page](https://github.com/josschavezf/clases_perl_2022)- [Joselyn C. Ch√°vez-Fuentes](https://josschavezf.netlify.app/). She is awesome and has some slides about Perl (in Spanish). You can reach out to her for personalized training (if she is available).
2. https://perlmaven.com 
3. ["The camel book"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-perl-4th/9781449321451/) also commercially known as "Programming Perl, 4th edition". The defacto Perl bible.
4. ["Learning Perl Exercises"](https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises) Pretty cool to start getting your hands dirty. Suggestion, try to pay for this books as much as you can afford to. OSS devs, writes and instructors got bills to pay.
5. The [Impacient Perl](http://www.greglondon.com/iperl/) book. It is awesome!!! If you thoroughly  follow through, you will be able to quickly update your resume. It does not dumb things down, but you will realize sooner or later that with Perl you cant really dumb much.
